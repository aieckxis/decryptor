# Python Script for Character Substitution Decryption
This repository contains an updated version of a Python script that accepts encrypted text as input and then decrypts it using character substitution. The program replaces certain characters with vowels to produce the original plain text. The script was originally created as part of an assignment 2 in problem 2 in Object-Oriented Programming course.
# Improvements
Git Process and Multiple Commits to keep track of the development process and changes made to the script, Git was used to manage the repository. Multiple commits were made with descriptive messages that explain the purpose and changes of each commit. By using Git, it was easy to revert to an earlier version of the code if necessary, and the changes could be reviewed and discussed with collaborators.
# Usage
To use the program, the user simply needs to run the script and follow the prompts. They are asked to enter the encrypted text, and the program replaces the specified characters with the corresponding vowels. The decrypted plain text is displayed on the screen.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, this repository includes a newer version of a Python script that uses character substitution to decrypt encrypted data. Git was used to manage the development process and track changes. With these updates, the script is now more dependable and user-friendly and can be applied to a wide range of text decryption applications.
